=>FOR FRONTEND......Product RECEIVESSSSS from ProductS!.....Yaani
              const Product = ({item}) => { 


=> In mongoDB COLLECTIONS means TABLES.....SCHEMA too


=> && means THEN


=> (req, res) only works for the USER!!!


=> process.env.JWT_SEC and process.env.PASS_SEC is just a DISGUISE
i.e take x disguise it as process.env.abcd


=> await keyword ni kama tu EXECUTE

=> $project is used as FIRSTLY EXTRACT....

{
    "username": "lamaUpdated",
    "password":"123456"
}
{
    "username": "mia",
    "password":"666"
}



=> useEffect executes after the return function below it is Executed!!

=> useSelector gets data from STORE page


STORE stores data that can be used by all pages in our app, 
ie. stores login info used by Login Page
and by Cart page.

<Provider> wraps around all pages that wish to use STORE services






QUESTIONS??
1) In the verifyToken...why do we use next and next()

2) Query sort in the users page







					2 WAYS TO FETCH DATA
					--------------------
useEffect(() => {
   const getProduct = async ()=>{
      try {
         const res = await publicRequest.get("/products/find/" + id)
         setProduct(res.data)
      } catch (error) {
         
      }
   }
    (1) getProduct()	&&  (2) return {x,y} //Maybe Tra, JvM or Mike Dane tutorial
  }, [id])
